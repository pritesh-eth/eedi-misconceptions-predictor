# Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics

This repository contains the code and resources for the Kaggle competition, ["Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/eedi-mining-misconceptions-in-mathematics). The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict student misconceptions based on incorrect answer choices (distractors) in multiple-choice mathematics questions.

## Why this project is useful

Understanding and identifying misconceptions in mathematics helps educators provide better-targeted support for students. This project automates the process of tagging misconceptions to multiple-choice answers using NLP and machine learning techniques, making the task faster and more scalable.

## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook locally, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle's notebook environment
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `nltk`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
